The metrics evaluated on the ensembles are in the Ensemble_Ouputs subdirectory. 

The function make_paper_plots.py processes these outputs and generates the figures used in the paper.

The function make_mms.py compares the mean-median values for different elections on the same districting plan. 

Data and software for generating similar ensembles is in Generate_Ensembles.zip.
